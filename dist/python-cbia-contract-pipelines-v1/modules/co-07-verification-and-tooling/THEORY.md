# Operational Readiness

## Theory

Operational readiness means code can be trusted to run unattended. This requires clarity, validation, logging, and predictable behavior.

From an operator perspective, readiness means:
- Inputs are validated
- Failures are explicit
- Outputs are deterministic
- Behavior is documented

Operational systems favor boring code. Predictability and simplicity are features, not limitations.

## Key Takeaways
- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- Make failure modes explicit.
- Design for unattended execution.
