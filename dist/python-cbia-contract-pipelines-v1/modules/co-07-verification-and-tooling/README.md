# Enforce correctness and stability with ruff, mypy, and pytest; verify contracts and transformations.

**Tags:** verification, testing, tooling, dev_practice

## Theory objectives

- **TH-10-contract-tests** — Tests validate contracts and transformations at boundaries; avoid mock-heavy internal testing.

## Skill objectives

- **1 SK-22-pytest-contract-tests** — Write pytest tests that validate model parsing, invariants, and render determinism. *(artefact: `tests/test_contracts.py`)*
- **2 SK-23-ruff-enforcement** — Configure and run ruff; ensure clean linting and formatting. *(artefact: `pyproject.toml (ruff section)`)*
- **3 SK-24-mypy-enforcement** — Configure mypy strictness appropriate for the repo and ensure it passes. *(artefact: `pyproject.toml (mypy section)`)*
